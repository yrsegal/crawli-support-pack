As a result of my inaptitude, I have been diagnosed with Genesis Syndrome.
Genesis Syndrome is when your body lacks the power to sustain the power of the Archetype.
Because of this, it acts as a parasite and drains the life out of its host.
Even if the Archetype is removed now, my body will most certainly not survive. This is goodbye.",

Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with Genesis Syndrome. I completely lost the ability to speak, and I think my vision is starting to fade as well.

This is what us humans get for becoming arrogant.
Garufa Incorporated will save all of us. They must.",

I was unable to manifest its power and was mortally wounded during a test.
I thought I actually had potential... But I guess not. The doctors say I don't have long left.
It's cruel, isn't it? Life is just so cruel.
But this is the path me and all the others chose. Humanity has nothing left but us.
...Is it all worth it in the end, though? What do we want to survive for? ...Anyway, I'm losing energy fast.

The Xenpurgis was designed to be the strongest Dimensional Rift created.
